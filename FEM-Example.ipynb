As a package in development there may be some breaking changes with each sucessive itereation.  pyxXEM is an extension of [hyperspy](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html), so reading some of their documentation is a good place to start in many cases. \n",

    "The first step in computing $V_\\Omega(k)$ is computing the annular average of each diffraction pattern, converting in effect from a 2D pattern $I(k_x, k_y)$ to a 1D pattern $I(k)$. This step involves finding the center of the pattern, correcting for any ellipticity, then calculating the average.\n",

If the data don't have a beam stop the [`diffraction_signal.center_direct_beam()`](https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem/blob/de140bb5dc19c0e9d1a91a725c656c2bd2c056d0/pyxem/signals/diffraction2d.py#L698) methods are better.\n",

    "If the TEM sample varies in thickness by more than a few nm over the entire dataset, thickness-related differences in the diffracted intensity $I(k)$ will dominate structure-related differences and therefore dominate $V_\\Omega(k)$. This effect can be avoided by using the HAADF signal or the high-angle scattering within the diffraction pattern to determine the local sample thickness, grouping the diffraction patterns into bins of nearly constant thickness, and only computing $V_\\Omega(k)$ for data inside a single bin. The $V_\\Omega(k)$ from different thickness bins then can be averaged together.
